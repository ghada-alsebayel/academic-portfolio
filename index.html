            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Northeastern University's <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Khoury College of Computer Sciences</a> in Boston, Massachusetts. I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/casper-harteveld/">Prof. Casper Harteveld</a> as part of the <a href="https://ghostlab.sites.northeastern.edu/">Ghost Lab</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Digital Health, with a strong emphasis on designing user-centered systems that foster ethical and empathetic digital experiences. Currently, my work focuses on designing and evaluating female-oriented health applications. I have experience in qualitative and quantitative research methods, usability testing, UX design principles, and participatory and transdisciplinary research.</p>
          <p> Before joining Northeastern University, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at King Saud University, where I earned a MSc in Information Systems and a BSc in Information Technology. Additionally, I have professional experience as a Systems Analyst in the Clinical Information Management Department at the National Guard Health Affairs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>Co-designed and co-organized an annual Computer Science (CS) summer school for girls at King Saud University, held from 2016 to 2018. The program introduced high school students to foundational concepts in artificial intelligence, robotics, programming, and game development, aiming to inspire and encourage more young women to pursue careers in STEM. The initiative was well-received and featured in <a href="https://www.al-jazirah.com/2016/20160906/to5.htm#google_vignette">local media</a> in Saudi Arabia.</p>
